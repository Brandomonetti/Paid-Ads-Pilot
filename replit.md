## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application uses a **React-based single-page application** with TypeScript for type safety. The frontend is built using Vite as the build tool and bundler, providing fast development and optimized production builds. The routing is handled by **Wouter**, a lightweight client-side routing library.

- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives for React
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography
- **Class Variance Authority**: Utility for managing conditional CSS classes

### Development Tools

- **TypeScript**: Static type checking
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for production builds
- **Replit Integration**: Development environment tools and runtime error handling

### State Management & API
- **TanStack React Query**: Server state management and caching
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management and validation
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation and schema definition

### File Upload System
- **Supabase Storage**: Cloud storage for knowledge base files (brand guidelines, research, media assets)
- **Deferred Upload Pattern**: Files are stored locally as "pending" until explicitly uploaded via Save button
- **Category-based Organization**: Files organized by category keys in JSONB structure: `{"category-key": [{name, url}]}`
- **File Categories**: brand-guidelines, customer-feedback, market-research, competitor-analysis, competitor-ads, ad-data, analytics, product-photos, lifestyle-images, video-content
- **Upload Flow**: 
  1. User selects files → stored locally as "pending" (shown with yellow badge)
  2. User clicks "Save Changes" → all pending files upload to Supabase in parallel
  3. After successful upload → form data saves to database
- **Deletion Flow**: Files marked for deletion (shown with red "Will delete" badge) are removed when Save is clicked

### Save Workflow (Updated October 2025)
The knowledge base dashboard implements a separated navigation and save workflow:

**Button Behavior:**
- **Previous/Next buttons**: Navigation only, disabled when there are unsaved changes
- **Save button**: Handles file uploads and data persistence, disabled when there are no changes

**Change Detection:**
- Tracks unsaved changes by comparing current state with saved state using deep comparison
- Saved state is initialized to empty baseline for new users
- When existing data loads, both current and saved states are synchronized

**Save Flow:**
1. User makes changes to form fields or selects files
2. Save button becomes enabled, Previous/Next buttons become disabled
3. User clicks Save button
4. All pending files are uploaded to Supabase in parallel
5. Form data is saved to database via POST/PATCH request
6. Saved state is updated to match current state
7. Success toast notification is displayed
8. Save button becomes disabled, Previous/Next buttons become enabled

This workflow ensures users never lose data by preventing navigation when there are unsaved changes, while maintaining a clear separation between navigation and persistence actions.

### AI & Content Generation
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: For AI content generation across all agents
  - Generates 4-5 diverse customer avatars at once based on knowledge base data
  - Analyzes brand positioning, demographics, and pain points
  - Creates targeted messaging and hooks for each avatar segment
- **Scrape Creator API**: For fetching real-world creative concepts from social media platforms
  - Fetches trending ad concepts from Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok
  - Provides engagement metrics, creative elements, and performance data
  - Integration key stored securely in Replit Secrets

### Research Agent Workflow (Updated October 2025)
The Research Agent implements an intelligent three-phase workflow for generating customer avatars and matching them with high-performing social media concepts:

**Phase 1: Avatar Generation**
- User clicks "Generate Avatars" button
- System generates 4-5 diverse customer avatars using OpenAI GPT-4
- Avatars are created based on knowledge base data (brand guidelines, customer feedback, market research)
- Each avatar includes: name, age range, demographics, pain points, and hooks
- All avatars saved to database and displayed in UI

**Phase 2: Concept Discovery**
- User clicks "Find Concepts" button (enabled only after avatars exist)
- System fetches trending ad concepts from three platforms via Scrape Creator API:
  - Facebook ads (includes engagement metrics, creative elements)
  - Instagram ads (includes platform-specific performance data)
  - TikTok ads (includes viral metrics and creative hooks)
- Concepts saved to database with full metadata

**Phase 3: Intelligent Auto-Linking**
- System automatically scores concept-to-avatar relevance using weighted algorithm:
  - Hook Matching (40%): Compares concept hooks with avatar pain points
  - Demographics Alignment (30%): Matches target audience characteristics
  - Performance Metrics (30%): Factors in engagement scores and reach
- Top 2 concepts per platform automatically linked to each avatar (6 total links per avatar)
- Deduplication logic prevents duplicate links on repeated workflow runs
- Relevance scores stored for ranking and filtering in UI

**User Interface Features:**
- Avatar cards with expandable details and approval workflow
- Concept cards filtered by selected avatar, ranked by relevance score
- Visual indicators for platform type (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok)
- Manual linking/unlinking capability with feedback collection
- Toast notifications showing counts of generated avatars, fetched concepts, and created links

**Data Flow:**
1. Knowledge Base → Avatar Generation (OpenAI)
2. Avatar Hooks → Concept Fetching (Scrape Creator API)
3. Concepts + Avatars → Intelligent Scoring Algorithm
4. Scored Matches → Auto-Linking (with deduplication)
5. Linked Results → UI Display (filtered and ranked)

This automated workflow eliminates manual research time and provides data-driven insights for targeted marketing campaigns.

### Planned Integrations
- **Meta Ads API**: For real-time performance data analysis
- **Third-party Asset Libraries**: For creative asset recommendations
- **Authentication Services**: For enhanced user management

The architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy addition of new AI agents and integration with external marketing platforms while maintaining a consistent user experience across the application.
